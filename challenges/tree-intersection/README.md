# Tree Intersection

## Challenge
Create function that takes two trees and returns the intersection of both.

## Approach & Efficiency
I planed my function on paper, did setup, outlined tests, and wrote and tested the function. Went with a breadth first transversal for implementing this function.

## API

### `treeIntersection(treeOne, treeTwo)`
Takes two trees and return an array of values that are shared between them. Returns null if there are no intersections.
