# Breadth First

## Challenge
Create a function that takes a tree and returns all the values in the tree in breadth first order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I did a lot of research to understand how to do it. I tried implementing my Queue class but it wouldn't work, so I used an array while using a queue's rules. I wasn't sure how to test for console logs, so I returned an array instead.

## API

### `breadthFirstTransversal(tree)`
Takes a tree and returns all the values in the tree in breadth first order.
