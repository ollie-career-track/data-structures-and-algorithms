# Queue with Stacks

## Challenge
Create a `psuedoQueue` class that instantiates with two empty stacks.

## Approach & Efficiency
Same as last time for the most time... I don't know if I did this right, but the methods work.

## API

### `enqueue(value)` Method
It creates a new node with the given value and adds it to the back of both stacks.

### `dequeue()` Method
It returns the value of the top of each stack and removes those nodes from each.
