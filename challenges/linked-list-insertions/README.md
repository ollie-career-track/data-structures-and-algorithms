# Linked List Insertions

## Challenge
Create methods for the linked list class that add a node to the end, before a specified node, and after a specified node.

## Approach & Efficiency
I did setup before working on the methods. I wrote the tests first then worked on a method until they all passed.

## API

### `append(value)` Method
This method creates a new node and adds it to the end of the linked list.

### `insertBefore(value, newValue)` Method
This method creates a new node and adds it before the node with the specified value.

### `insertAfter(value, newValue)` Method
This method creates a new node and adds it after the node with the specified value.
