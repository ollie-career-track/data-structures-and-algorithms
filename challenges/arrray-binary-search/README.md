# Search an Array

## Challenge

Write a function that takes a sorted array and a search key. The function returns the index of the element equalling the search key. If the array, doesn't contain the element, it returns -1.

## Approach & Efficiency

I did setup, wrote tests, and then worked through them one at a time. I went with the "brute force" approach for my function.
