# Fizzbuzz Tree

## Challenge
Create a function that takes a tree and returns a tree with "fizz", "buzz", and "fizzbuzz" values. 

## Approach & Efficiency

I did some setup, wrote a couple tests, and wrote some notes. Then I implemented the fizz buzz and fizzbuzz parts one by one before running the function on a tree that had all types of values.

## API

### `fizzBuzzTree(tree)`
The function takes a tree and returns a the tree with new values. Values divisible by 3 become "fizz". Values divisible by 5 become "buzz". And values divisible by both 3 and 5 become "fizzbuzz".
