# Repeated Word

## Challenge
Create a function that takes a long string and returns the first word in the string that repeats.

## Approach & Efficiency
I wrote most of the function first because I didn't know everything I needed to test at first. Otherwise, followed a similar process. Used regex to get rid of extra spaces and punctuation.

## API

### `repeatedWord(lengthyWord)`
Takes a long string and returns the first word that repeats in the string. Returns null if no repeated word.
