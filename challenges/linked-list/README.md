# Singly Linked List Implementation

## Challenge
Create a linked list data a structure class with methods and node class.

## Approach & Efficiency
Terrible approach. Very inefficient. Took over 2 weeks to complete. 

## API

### `Insert` Method
Insert takes a value and adds a new node to the beginning of the list.

### `Includes` Method
Includes takes a value and searches the list to see if it contains it. It returns false if it doesn't contain it.

### `toString` Method
Returns all values within the linked list as a string.
