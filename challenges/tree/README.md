# Binary Tree Implementation

## Challenge
Create a `BinarySearchTree` class with an `add` and `contains` methods. Create a `BinaryTree` class with `preOrder`, `postOrder`, and `inOrder` methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
Inefficient. Figure out how to search for a value then get stumped on an add method that only takes one argument before realizing a function can be passed into the method... Otherwise, the same as the last README says I'm sure...

## API

### `add(value)` method 
Creates a new node with a given value and inserts it in the proper place in the tree.

### `contains(value)`
Takes a value and looks for it within tree. Returns true if tree contains value. Returns false if tree does not contain value.

### `preOrder()`
Returns an array of values in tree sorted by preOrder.

### `inOrder()`
Returns an array of values in tree sorted by inOrder.

### `postOrder()`
Returns an array of values in tree sorted by postOrder.
