# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

Initially, I wrote the function so that it could only take an array with a length of 4. Then, I refactored the code to allow for an array of any length to be passed in.
